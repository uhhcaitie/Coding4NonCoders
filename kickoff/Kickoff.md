### *How to view this file*

*This is a Markdown file denoted by its ".md" extension. It is used by programmers
as a way to store documentation in a Project. There is nothing special about 
this file as opposed to any other text file. They are both just text. 
Markdown files generally follow specific conventions, with symbols like 
"#" denoting headers, or an asterisk denoting a bullet point. 
Some editors and applications can render Markdown files to produce an 
enriched document. In VSCode this is done using Ctrl + K V*

# Setting Up
## Git
Git is a popular Version Control System used. Version Control Systems are 
programs that help us maintain a history and track changes to a project over time.
Git is your friend and you should keep it close by. It can be used through its Command Line Interface using a Terminal like "CMD", or through a graphical application (GUI). Either works. I highly suggest familiarizing yourself with how to
use Git, especially the basic concepts of Cloning, Adding, Committing, and Pushing changes.

# Exercise 1

Run printing.py by calling the python interpreter on your `printing.py` file.

```shell
$ cd kickoff
$ python printing.py
```

1. Add another print statement after line 5 to print your name.
2. Fix the spelling of "Montevideo" on line 7. Run printing.py again. What happens?
